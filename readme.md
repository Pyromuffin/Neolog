First please install sbt, and if it asks you to choose a java version, java 21 is the latest supported version of java for this framework.

then do `sbt run` to start the server

then visit http://localhost:9000/ to view the Neolog.

Currently, the database of neologisms and corpus of all english words for the Tonitrus system are located at the root directory of the repository.
